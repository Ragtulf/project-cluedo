# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

A project in week 5 of the Technigo Frontend Developer Bootcamp.
This is a randomizer that picks a killer, murder weapon and the murder scene at random and displays it first on the cards and then you can push a button to "reaveal the crime".

## The problem

This is a project that focuses on javascript. I was a really fun project that seemed so hard at first but now it makes so much sense. I ended up having the click event in the html. I would have liked to spend more time styling it but I decited to spend my energies the javascript side.
